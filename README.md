### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a backend software developer and tinkerer working at [Stackable][stackable]. I currently work on
stackable-lib, stackablectl, and stackabled (see [here][stackable-work]). In my spare time I work on
a scalable high-performance [DNS Server][portal] with DNS blocking features and a home router OS,
called [vulcan-rs][vulcan], both written in pure Rust ðŸ¦€.
